## 2. Config Arduino IDE for ESP Boards ⚙️

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to **File > Preferences**.
3. In the **Additional Boards Manager URLs** field, add the following URL for ESP boards:
   ```
   https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
4. Click **OK** to save the preferences.
5. Go to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager...**.
6. Search for "ESP32" or "ESP8266" and install the relevant package. name it "ESP32 by Espressif Systems" or "ESP8266 by ESP8266 Community".

## 3. Add the Template Logic
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirali-lll/crawling-bot.git
```
2. Create new Sketch in Arduino IDE **File > New Sketch**.
3. Copy the contents of `templates/template.ino` into your new sketch.
4. Save the sketch with a meaningful name.


## 4. Install Required Libraries 📚
1. Select the Library Manager from the Arduino IDE (It is located at the left side of the IDE).
2. Search for and install any libraries required by your project (Each library is mentioned in the `template.ino`)
